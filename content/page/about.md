This website hosts presently and previously scheduled discussions for the
planning and control group, a student run weekly discussion on planning and
control. The content we cover varies considerably depending on interest, varying
from research papers, results from conferences, or anything that someone finds
novel enough to present.


Workload depending, we meet weekly on Mondays, 2pm at J04 at the Australian
Centre For Robotics (ACFR), University of Sydney. These meetings, while mostly
in-person, have a zoom meeting alongside them allowing for remote participation.
If you'd like to participate in these meetings, please let us know!
