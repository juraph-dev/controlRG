This website hosts presently and previously scheduled discussions for the
planning and control group, a student run weekly discussion on planning and
control. The content we cover varies considerably depending on interest, varying
from research papers, results from conferences, or anything that someone finds
novel enough to present.


Workload depending, we meet weekly on Fridays, 11am at J04 at the Australian
Centre For Robotics (ACFR), University of Sydney. These meetings, while mostly
in-person, have a zoom meeting alongside them allowing for remote participation.
If you'd like to participate in these meetings, please let us know!

This reading group is made up of members from the [Australian Center for Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-robotics.html), and the [Australian Robotic Inspection and Asset Management Hub](https://ariamhub.com/). 

The layout of this website, as well as the system for scheduling was inspired by the [Imaging Reading group](https://roboticimaging.github.io/ImgRG/). Thanks!


<!-- This website keeps track of the on-going imaging reading group activities. You will be able to find the schedule of the upcoming reading sessions, past presentations, related articles and a curated list of resources on imaging. -->

<!-- Our meetings generally alternate between reviewing a recent paper in detail, a section of a computational imaging textbook, and conference proceedings. Topics of interest span most of visual computing including computational imaging, computer vision, machine learning, and graphics covering novel cameras, representations and algorithms/architectures that let robots see and do. -->

<!-- The meetings are held once a week (day and time subject to change depending on availabilities) in hybrid mode: via Zoom and hopefully and in-person at J04/J18 conference rooms, Australian Centre For Robotics (ACFR), The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia. If you like to join Robotic Imaging Reading Group, feel free to contact us. -->
